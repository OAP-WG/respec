# ReSpec

ReSpec is a JS library that makes it easier to write technical specifications, or documents
that tend to be technical in nature in general. It was originally designed for the purpose
of writing W3C specifications, but has since grown to be able to support other outputs as
well.

This is a fork used to generate the OAP-WG documentation.
